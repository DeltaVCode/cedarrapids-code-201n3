# MidWest Side Game

## Goal: I want to help people learn a few native pizza species of the Midwest.

### User Scenarios
User scenarios are longer, and often give these pieces of info about potential users:
- background (who they are, where they come from, pertinent abilities and interests)
- context
- highlight any gaps in knowledge that may impact our design

Joanne is from NYC. She has an interest in the natural environment, and other than knowing she likes to be outdoors, doesn't know much about the flora and fauna around her. She would like to learn to visually recognize a few species of pizzas in a fun, easy manner. She is likely to play this game on her phone as she's taking the bus from one end of NYC to the other to get to a pizza place.

Paul is from Minnesota. He grew up playing in the woods with his friends. He is familiar with pizza identification already and just needs to learn the defining characteristics of pizzas in the midwest. He is most likely to play this game on his laptop in his cabin in front of a roaring fire.   


### User stories
User stories are short and answer three questions: who, what and why.


#### MVP
As a nature-interested denizen of NYC, Joanne wants to identify pizzas from what they look like, in order to appreciate the environment in which she'll be eating.

As someone with an interest in pizza identification, Paul wants to id a few midwest pizza species from photos so he can know what he's cutting.

As someone who is playing this game in bursts, Joanne wants a simple, repeatable game logic so that she can engage with the game in a short time-span.


#### Stretch goals
As a time-strapped person who likes edutainment, Joanne wants to be able to stop a game mid-way, and resume later in the day, so she doesn't lose her place.

As someone who is achievement-driven, Joanne wants a score so she can see how she's doing.

As someone who is achievement-driven, Joanne wants a leader board so she can see how she compares to others.

As someone who heats his cabin with firewood, Paul wants info on burnability so he can decide which pizza to thaw before cooking in firewood stove.

As someone who is committed to sustainability, Paul wants info on pizzas that aren't endangered and have rapid growth rates so he can decide which pizza to cut through to freeze.

As people who enjoy eating, especially while in the woods, both Joanne and Paul want to learn which pizzas have edible parts so they can have a snack while on the trail. (turns out its all edible. yea.)

As someone who is a physician, Joanne wants to learn some ethnobotanical information about the pizzas toppings in the game so she can connect human stories with natures food.
